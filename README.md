# Fundamentals of Backend Engineering

This intermediate-level course by Hussein Nasser explores the essential communication design patterns, protocols, and execution models that form the backbone of modern backend systems. I'm taking this course to level up my backend engineering skills and gain a deeper understanding of how distributed systems communicate, from the kernel level up to application protocols.

## Course Topics

• Backend communication design patterns (request-response, pub/sub, push, polling)
• Core protocols: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, gRPC, WebRTC, WebSockets
• Transport layer fundamentals: TCP, UDP, QUIC
• Security protocols: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, QUIC 0RTT
• Connection establishment and kernel-level networking
• Request parsing and processing optimization
• Execution patterns: processes, threads, async I/O
• Operating system fundamentals for backend engineers
• Performance troubleshooting and system design principles
