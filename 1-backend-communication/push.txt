Request/Response isn't always ideal.
- Client wants real time notifications from the backend.

Push model is good for real time notifications.

How it works:
1. Client establishes connection to a server
2. Server sends data to the client
3. Client doesn't have to request anything.
   - Protocol is usually bidirectional
4. Server pushes data to the client whenever their is an action item in the queue.

Example: RabbitMQ

Pros:
- Real time

Cons:
- Client must be online/connected to the server
- Clients might not be able to handle the data volume
- Requires bidirectional protocol
- Polling is required for light clients

Tip: When a connection is established, there is always a client source port and IP, and a server source port and IP. The client source port can be used as a unique identifier for the client.
