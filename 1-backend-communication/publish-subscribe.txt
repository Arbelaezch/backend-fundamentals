Publish/Subscribe
One publisher, many readers.

Publisher sends a message to a topic/channel, and subscribers receive messages from that topic. The same service can be both a publisher and a subscriber.


Pros:
- Scales well with multiple receivers
- Great for microservices
- Loose coupling

Cons:
- Message delivery issues. How do you ensure that the message is delivered to all subscribers?
- Complexity
- Network saturation. If a lot of subscribers are connected, the publisher might not be able to send messages fast enough.
