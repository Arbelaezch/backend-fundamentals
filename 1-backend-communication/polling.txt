Short Polling
Request is taking a while, I'll check with you later.

It's short because it's a very quick time to poll.
E.x.: Is this thing done or not?
E.x.: Uploading a youtube video.

Commonly used when you have a large request that you want to process asynchronously on the backend. You don't want to block the client while the request is being processed.


What is Short Polling?
1. Client sends a request
2. Server responds immediately with a handle (unique identifier for the request)
3. Server continues to process the request
4. Client uses that handle to check for status by sending multiple "short" request/response as polls.

Technically, making the poll is a request/response. The whole workflow is based on asynchronous communication.


Pros:
- Simple
- Good for long running requests
- Client can disconnect

Cons:
- Too chatty (too many requests). Most of these requests are completely useless (false).
- Network bandwidth is wasted
- Wasted backend resources
