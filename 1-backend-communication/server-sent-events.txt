Server Sent Events (SSE)
One Request, a very very long response.

- Client sends a request
- Server responds with a stream of events with chunks of important data interspersed.
- Client receives events as they are sent and parses the important data in the long stream.
- Server never writes the end of the response.

Pros:
- Real time
- Compatible with Request/Response

Cons:
- Client must be online & connected to the server
- Clients might not be able to handle the data volume
- Polling is preferred for light clients
- HTTP/1.1 problem (6 connection limitation)
