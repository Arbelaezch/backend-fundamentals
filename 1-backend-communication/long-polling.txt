Long Polling
Request is taking too long, I'll check with you later. Talk to me only when it's ready.

Client makes a poll request to the server, but the server doesn't respond immediately or until there is an entry in the queue.

Used by Kafka

Pros:
- Less chatty than short polling
- Confirms that the client can handle the request, unlike push
- Client can disconnect

Cons:
- Not real time; client needs to make the request first before it can receive the response.
